# giuliani-helper-server

Server side code for Giuliani Arpeggio helper app.

This app enables classical and finger style guitarists to choose a specific number of exercises from 'Mauro Giuliani's 120 Right Hand Studies' based on difficulty, or from the entire set. The studies returned are shuffled/randomized and are displayed nicely for ease of use.

Uses the MongoDb / Express / React / Node (MERN) stack.
